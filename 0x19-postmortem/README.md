## Postmortem: Hardware Issues in ZSI Environmental Robot Project

### Issue Summary

- **Duration:** April 1, 2024, 10:00 AM UTC - April 3, 2024, 8:00 AM UTC
- **Impact:** Complete system downtime affecting data collection, analysis, and autonomous operation.
- **Root Cause:** Multiple hardware failures in the robot's design, electrical connections, ESP32, Raspberry Pi, solar panels, servers, coding, API, database machine, and connections.
  
### Timeline

- **Detection:** April 1, 2024, 10:00 AM UTC, Monitoring alerts indicated communication loss with the robot.
- **Actions Taken:**
  - Investigated ESP32 and Raspberry Pi connections, assuming a communication error.
  - Checked solar panel output, assuming power failure.
  - Examined server logs for coding or API issues, assumed database connection error.
- **Misleading Paths:** Initial focus on ESP32 and Raspberry Pi communication overlooked broader hardware issues.
- **Escalation:** Incident escalated to the hardware and software teams for thorough investigation.
- **Resolution:** April 3, 2024, 8:00 AM UTC, Hardware issues identified and fixed, including faulty electrical connections, damaged ESP32 and Raspberry Pi components, and inefficient solar panel usage.
  
### Root Cause and Resolution
